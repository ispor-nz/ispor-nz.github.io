We are very pleased to announce the next ISPOR NZ webinar will be presented by **Dr Chunhuan Lao**.

Dr Lao is a biostatistician and health economist at the University of Waikato with 10 years' experience of using the national administrative datasets. Her PhD thesis was about the costs and cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening and treatments. After her PhD, she has worked in other HRC-funded projects, on breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, diabetes and co-occurrence of diabetes. Currently, she is working on a project "Characteristics, management, outcomes, and costs of systemic lupus erythematosus in New Zealand" funded by Arthritis New Zealand as a 3-year fellowship.

In this seminar, she will talk about her research on using the national administrative datasets and linkage with other registers, including Te Rēhita Mate Ūtaetae - Breast Cancer Foundation New Zealand National Register, the Midland Lung Cancer Register, and the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA).
