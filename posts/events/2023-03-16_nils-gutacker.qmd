We are very pleased to announce the next ISPOR NZ webinar will be presented by **Prof Nils Gutacker**.

Prof Gutacker is a Professor of Health Economics at the Centre for Health Economics, University of York, and a Visiting Professor at Macquarie Business School, Sydney. His research focuses on the impact of incentives and market structures on the equitable and efficient provision of health care services. He has a long-standing interest in the use of routinely collected patient-reported outcome measures to measure quality of care and value for money in the health care system.

In this talk, he will discuss the potential uses of patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) data to improve equity, efficiency and value for money in the provision of health care services adopting an economistâ€™s point of view.
