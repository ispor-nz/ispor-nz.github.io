His research program focuses on pharmaceutical policy and the access to and use of prescription drugs, including the affordability of prescription drugs, private drug insurance, generic drug pricing, and the impact of pharmacist prescribing.\nIn this talk, Prof Law will discuss the use of biosimilars to improve competition and reduce drug costs. Biosimilars - agents with with similar efficacy and safety to originator biologic drugs - offer an important avenue for cost savings to address the growing expenditure on biologics, yet their uptake remains low. Prof Law will discuss the impact of policies to strengthen the biosimilars market and increase their uptake, drawing on an analysis of the Canadian experience.\nThe webinar will be held at 10am on Wednesday 15 June."

His research focuses on the cost-effectiveness and health technology assessment of diagnostic imaging in musculoskeletal conditions and on sustainability in the healthcare system.\nIn this talk, he will discuss methods for integrating carbon emissions into health technology assessments. Globally, health care is responsible for 4.4% of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, and many countries have committed to achieving low-carbon or net-zero carbon health services; however, carbon emissions are not currently considered when evaluating health technologies. Dr Docking will discuss several ways in which carbon emissions could be integrated with HTA, and what needs to be done to enable the routine consideration of carbon emissions in HTA.\nThe webinar will be held at 1pm on Thursday 22 June.

    "text": "5 modules over 5 weeks from Mon 23 October to Fri 24 November 2023\n\nA new online course focusing on methods for analysing equity in the distribution of health programme costs and effects and trade-offs between equity and cost-effectiveness. Delivered by the Centre for Health Economics, University of York, UK, in collaboration with the Bergen Centre for Ethics and Priority Setting in Health, University of Bergen, Norway.\nThis new online short course in distributional cost-effectiveness analysis (DCEA) provides hands-on training in methods for analysing the health inequality impacts of health programmes and trade-offs with cost effectiveness.\nThe course is led by Professor Richard Cookson and based on the Oxford University Press handbook of Distributional Cost-Effectiveness Analysis. It involves ‘bite-size’ video presentations by the authors of the handbook, hands-on exercises in MS Excel, online discussion forums, and “live” Q&A sessions (1 hour per module), requiring approximately 4 hours of study time per week (20 hours altogether).\nThe course is aimed at health economists and other analysts with experience of health economic evaluation, who wish to learn how to use more specialised methods for analysing distributional impacts on health inequality and trade-offs with cost-effectiveness. It is designed for people familiar with cost-effectiveness analysis and it is envisaged that participants will currently be undertaking distributional cost-effectiveness analysis, or planning to do so in the near future.\nFor enquiries, full details and to book a place, please click the link below:\nhttps://www.york.ac.uk/che/courses/dcea-course/"

She returns in 2022 as a health economist with considerable experience in undertaking economic evaluations and the application of new methods. In this talk she will present some methodological challenges that she’d like to work on in Aotearoa. This includes understanding how to measure productivity loss, how equity features in HTA guidelines and what is the societal perspective and how could it include carbon to tackle the climate crisis. Paula would welcome feedback on these ideas and approaches to collaborate.\n\nAbout the presenter\nPaula Lorgelly is a Professor of Health Economics at the University of Auckland. She has a distinguished career working in academia in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand (including a visiting position in Germany), and the independent sector in the United Kingdom. Whilst in Australia she was a member of the Economics Sub-Committee of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), and in this capacity provided advice on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatments seeking reimbursement on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Her research interests span three defined areas: the determinants of health and healthcare, economic evaluation and outcome measurement. She has worked across the health and medical spectrum and much of her research focuses on cancer, and more recently on long COVID. She has experience across a range of methodologies including the analysis of trial data, decision analytic modelling, econometric analyses of health surveys including panel data, preference elicitation using discrete choice experiments and qualitative analyses. Paula is the outgoing national organiser of the UK Health Economists’ Study Group, the co-chair of the forthcoming iHEA Congress, a member of the EuroQol Group, and on the Editorial Boards of the Journal of Cancer Policy, The Patient and the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health."
